## Conditions
Conditions are checks that must be met before an action or feature can be used.
They can validate things like permissions, items, or placeholders. You can combine multiple requirements and control what happens if they are met or not.

### Syntax
```yaml
conditions:
  # Sets the actions to run when all requirements are met.
  success-actions: ACTIONS

  # Sets the actions to run when the requirements are not met.
  deny-actions: ACTIONS

  # Sets how many requirements from the list must be fulfilled.
  # If not set, all listed requirements will be required.
  minimum-requirements: 1

  # Lists all the requirements that will be checked.
  requirements:
   - type: has permission
     permission: rank.vip
```

### Requirement types

| # | Type            | Description                                                                 |
|---|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
